                Since I just want to use my computer to finish some easy and non-demanding work, this computer is suitable. Besides, all the fast USB 3.0 ports is placed in front
                which is quite thoughtful. I'll recommend this computer for those who have some effortless workload.

                This desktop allow me to multitask without slowing down it.It also won't take up much space because of its compact casing. But I think i would need a more powerful
                processor since I would have to edit a lot of photos and videos. Overall, I still satisfied with this desktop though.

                    This Lenovo Legion 5 is excellent. I was looking for a laptop with a powerful CPU, 
                    a decent GPU for the occasional content creating, and a good and accurate screen. 
                    This one here checks all those boxes and has some great other features too.
                    Besides,their delivery service also fast and good.

                Optimised for gaming. While laptops with an RTX 3080 offer a whole lot of performance, 
                they are often chunky and can get really hot, which is not something that everybody wants. 
                The Acer Nitro 5, on the other hand, is for those who are looking for a low-priced portable gaming laptop.

               The only things i'm not satisfied is the small screen. Overall, it is a good laptop.

                The Poco F3 is one of the finest phone I ever buy because of it's premium design and 
                solid set of cameras make for an excellent smartphone experience.
                The only weakness is the underwhelming battery life.

                Decided to buy this after my last phone broke, one of the best phone I ever use. The camera is the feature I like the 
                most as I'm a person who like to tae picture. Recommend this to people that also like photography.

                The screen is really an ideal choice for a superior gaming experience and my phone is cloud shadow blue, 
                it is beautiful!! It also can be fully charged in only 30 minutes which is really fast.

                This phone is easy to use one-handed since it is not really big and the phone design is so unique and distinctive.
                Unfortunately, it heats up quite easily when gaming.

                    The camera is one of the best I ever use but the price is quite high. This tablet also only available in two color.
                    Still a good tablet nonetheless.

                    The perfomance is good, the battery life is good and the speaker is also good. The only thing I don't like is the design, 
                    a little bit plain but it is still a good tablet with this price.

                    I use it to study the notes in that PDF form, the result is so good,also good if use to watch movie.
                    Battery life is strong and the charging speed is also fast. I get this tablet three days after I order
                    ,is quite fast.

                   The screen is big enough and it is easy to use. The design looks nice and perfomance also good. Hope that it won't have any problem 
                   in the future.

                   The quality is good, the pad is light. The eye protection mode is so nice and really suitable for the children who use it to study
