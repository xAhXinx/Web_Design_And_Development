        <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
        <p class="story">
            Anything About Electronic Device (AAED), the organization which was formed by me and three of my friends. We met each other in University College and have many similarities such as we love discussing electronic devices. 
            In 2018, we decided to start an organization to help everyone around us to know more about electronic devices. After a few months we thought about making money through this so we then sell electronic devices and share our knowledge about electronic devices to anyone who is struggling with these problems. 
            We have an electronic device shop in Kuala Lumpur and our business is not bad after all. Unfortunately, Covid-19 spread all over the world including Malaysia in March 2020. Our business is getting worse and worse due to the continuous lockdown. So, we decided to form an online shopping website called ‘Toppee’.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3 class="website">TOPPEE</h3>
        <p class="toppee">
            We mainly sell desktops, laptops and their components. Both desktop and laptop have a ‘top’ behind them, this is how the name <b>‘Toppee’</b> came from. While you are reading this, you have found the correct place. Our organization is called <b>AAED</b> for a reason. 
            Any issues or problems about electronic devices, we would love to help you with that.
            We may not have all types of smartphones or tablets selling on our website, because we only sell the best ones. 
            In the online shopping website, we will give the clearest clarification of the items so that our customers can do comparison and make the right decision. 
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Example of components? No worries. Any input and output devices you can find right here. You want the best components for gaming? We have gaming sets and so on. Oh, you want only one of them, we have ‘a la carte’ shopping method just like McDonalds. 
            <b>‘Toppee’</b> sells the most various electronic devices. Anything you want to know about desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, input and output devices, and components, we will provide you with the best option.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3 class="mission">OUR MISSION</h3>
        <p class="goals">
            The aim of creating this online shopping website are to help people to be able to shop electronic devices needed conveniently and to solve their difficulties in computers during this pandemic. It is hard to head out especially in this situation, but our organization perfectly solves this problem. Those who have questions about computers or who admit some problems during shopping or have urgent issues can <a href="ContactUs.html">contact or email us.</a>
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;The objective of building an online shopping website is to develop new clients. Compared with a shop only with a physical store, a shop with a physical store and online shop is easier to let our potential customers interact with us. 
            Through this website, customers can collect all the information they want and need without going through a long journey to the physical shop. To provide our clients a better experience when using our website, the website must be user-friendly and try to simplify the process as much as possible as simple as possible.             
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Besides, our website must satisfy customer’s requirements by building a website with many functionalities. We actually find it hard to predict what our customers’ problems will be faced by them as every customer is facing different problems. The only thing we can do is just provide a channel to help them to solve their problem on the journey of shopping.
            We can build up the channel of solving problems by providing our online customer service, <a href="ContactUs.html">contact number</a> of our shop and a page that collects <a href="CustomerFeedback.html">customer feedback or reviews</a>. This will let our customers stay with us and give them a reason to come back.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;On the other hand, we want to build our brand and let our website become an authoritative resource that can establish trust from the viewer of this website. We must provide correct information about our selling product. The latest electrical devices also need to be updated by us as soon as possible. If we can provide first-hand information, our customers will be more satisfied with it.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;All of this objective lastly also will back to the main goal of starting a business which is to increase the sales and the profit. A website is such a good way to help us to achieve our ultimate goal.
